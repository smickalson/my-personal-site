            <h2> A little bit about me.</h2>
              <div class="half-width">
                  <p> I've made my home base in Kaysville, Utah, with my growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in Human Resources. As I joined a tech company, I was fascinated with the inner workings of the tech industry. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my specific needs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width">
                  <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to wrtie clean, elegant code.</p>
